# Freelancer Service for Freelancer4J


---
Compile, Package, and Run
---

```
## with UT
mvn clean package

## without UT
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```
**NOTICE:** Due to the fact that running the service will require a workable ProstgreSQL database, and the UT test all functions using embedded H2 DB, the service can not be run locally


---
Deploying the project to OpenShift
---
**Login OpenShift using CLI and switch to working project, then execute following commands.**

```
## make sure using same version of OC client as the OpenShift cluster
oc new-app postgresql-ephemeral -p POSTGRESQL_USER=luke \
                                -p POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=secret \
                                -p POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=my_data \
                                -p DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME=my-database

mvn clean fabric8:deploy -Popenshift
